### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character from a climate-displaced community confronts Sylvie at one of her curated charity galas, weaponizing the language of 'sustainability' against her.
- Explore a day in the life of Aris, Sylvie's assistant, detailing the emotional labor and moral compromises required to maintain her world.
- Write a flashback chapter showing Sylvie and Kael as children, discovering something in nature that first defined their divergent paths.
- Create a manifesto from Dr. Armita's perspective, outlining the principles of 'Feral Science' versus 'Curation Science'.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a speculative interface for Sylvie's 'exquisite, ruthless architecture of influence'—a dashboard that visualizes carbon credits, social sentiment, and ecological assets as a manipulable game board.
- Model the hydro-engineering 'tweak' Sylvie proposes: create a system diagram showing the levee, the Living Archive's water table, and the 5% flow reduction, with projected impacts on both the fungal bloom and the Riverside Development.
