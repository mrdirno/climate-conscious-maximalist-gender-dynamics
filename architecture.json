  "cover_prompt": "A young man with feral, earth-stained hands defiantly cradles a sapling against the chest of his immaculate, silk-clad sister, their tense standoff set within the dripping, bioluminescent interior of a vast, transparent arboreal skyscraper that towers above a drowned city, the scene a clash of organic wildness and sterile, curated luxury. This intimate, charged confrontation unfolds in a vertical garden atrium where engineered orchids twine with invasive moss, overlooking a perpetual storm through panoramic glass, capturing the novel's core tension between performative eco-luxury and radical, muddy stewardship. Rendered in the hyper-detailed, allegorical style of Remedios Varo with the lush, climatic maximalism of Anna Dittmann and the gendered architectural tension of Soey Milk, blending symbolic surrealism with breathtaking environmental detail. Centered, book-cover composition with a dramatic low-angle shot that emphasizes the towering, fragile canopy structure and the siblings' power dynamic, their figures framed by the intricate geometry of the building and the chaotic beauty of the encroaching wild. Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting with cold, artificial neon accents from data-panels cutting through the warm, bioluminescent glow of the flora, palette of deep emerald greens, bruised purples, silvery metallics, and stark, clinical white contrasted with rich, earthy browns and vibrant mossy golds. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev"
